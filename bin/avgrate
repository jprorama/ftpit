# compute the transfer average from the status line rate updates
#
# note that this will produce a different rate than the one in the lftp transfer log
# the reason is because the status line is alwasy averaged over a one second time interval
# irrespective of the actual fractional second time it may have taken.
# The rate in the log file is based on the time from start measured bytes to the end of 
# transfer. See the Speedometer.cc for details:
#
# https://github.com/lavv17/lftp/blob/master/src/Speedometer.cc#L51 
# 
# Unfortunately the actual transfer time is not reported anywhere and not rate is recorded
# for failed transfers.  Hence this estimate.
